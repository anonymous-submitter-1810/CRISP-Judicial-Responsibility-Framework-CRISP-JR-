# CRISP-JR Framework

This repository contains the visual framework and supplementary materials for the paper:
**"BRIDGING PROCESS MINING AND THE COURTROOM THROUGH CRISP-JUDICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FRAMEWORK (CRISP-JR)"**

## Contents
- Significant transition patterns map for Cluster 2 (cluster_2_networkx_graph)
- Case duration distribution by cluster, grouped by chamber (duration_by_cluster_grouped_by_chamber)
- Activity percolation roles heatmap (activity_percolation_roles_heatmap)
- Duration distribution comparison by chamber within cluster and year (cases started and ended in same year) (cases_started_ended_same_year)

## Code Availability
The implementation code for the CRISP-JR framework will be made available upon paper acceptance to ensure review integrity and proper attribution.
